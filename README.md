I went on a 5 days sprint of completing some of my previously started projects and i was able to deploy 2.

I built a Whatsapp chat Analysis tool that enables whatsapp users to upload their whatsapp chat with their contacts and get some insights into how many messages is sent by them, how many message per day and message per month. currently hosted on Heroku. <a href="https://www.whatsapp-chat-analysis.heroku.com">here</a>
