## Whatsapp Chat Analysis

wanted to replicate what fracis did but it turns out i could add some flavor to it so i decided to create a gui using streamlit that allows you to import any whatsapp chat data (DMs or GCs) one at a time though and get some analysis and insights into how the relationship is. etc

## How to Run :running:
The file wh_chat_analysis.py is the source file
1. Clone project
2. Navigate to the cloned project
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run `streamlit run wh_chart_analysis.py`

It will open on a specific port and use your default web browser then you can upload your chat data and get some insights
NB: Feedbacks are hihgly appreciated :hugging_face: :blob-100: :blob-clap:

### Tools used (tech)
1. Python
2. Streamlit
3. Plotly
4. Matplotlib
5. Pandas
..

The project can still be improved, and i plan on doing this soon.

Thank You and enjoy
